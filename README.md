## Overview of World Weather Analysis 
The overview of this project was to help customers find the best locations to travel to and provide them good options for hotels based on their preferences of weather and distance. I did this by connecting to the Weather Database and Google API to extract information on weather and geographical coordinates to provide accurate and effective results for the customer. In the end, I was able to provide the customer with a travel route of four cities along with hotels they can stay at that matches their preferences.
