Using jupyter notebook for world weather analysis 

## Overview of Election Audit 
The overview of this project was to help customers find the best locations to travel to and provide them good options for hotels based on their preferences of weather and distance. I did this by connecting to the Weather Database and Google API to extract information on weather and geographical coordinates to provide accurate and effective results for the customer.
